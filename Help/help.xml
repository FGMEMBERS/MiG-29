<text>
This is an experimental model representing the earlier Mig-29 9-12
aircraft. All settings and procedures are best-guess.

Flaps extend to 20 degrees, with 4 positions:
  3.2, 6.4, 12.8, 20

Extend leading edge slats for better performance at higher angles
of attack at the expense of increased drag.

Reheat engages at 90% throttle or greater.

Takeoff :
  flaps 1/4
  maintain slight down elevator until rotation
  rotation at ~150 kts
  retract gear at ~220 kts
  retract flaps at ~240 kts
Approach :
  flaps 1/4 below 240 kts
  extend gear below 220 kts
  flaps 1/2 below 200 kts
  flaps 3/4 below 170 kts
  flaps full below 150 kts 
Landing :
  Optimal touch down at around 155 kts (250km/hour)
  AoA 10-11 degrees

Dorsal intake vents open and main intake screens close upon main
gear compression (weight on wheels). This is meant to prevent
foreign object ingestion, as the Mig-29 like many Russian aircraft
was designed to operate from rough fields.
